      <h1> Where can I get some? </h1>
      <p> <b>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
      <br>alteration in some form, by injected humour, or <strong><u>randomized words</u></strong> which don't look even slightly
      <br>believable</b>. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
      <br>embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. <i>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
      <br>predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet</i>. It uses a dictionary of over
      <br>200 Latin words, combined with a handful  of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
      <br>reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-
      <br>characteristic words etc.</p>
      
      <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
      <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
      <br>industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
      <br>scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
      <br>electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
      <br>Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
      <br><u><strong><em>Aldus PageMaker</em></strong></u> including versions of <u>Lorem Ipsum</u>. 1914 translation by H. Rackham
      <br>
      <br>
 <blockquote>Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore
 <br>et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi
 <br>ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequant. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse
 <br>cillum dolore eu fugait nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in colpa
 <br>qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</blockquote>

 <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
 <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
 <br>layout. The point of using <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
 <br>using <q>Content here, content here</q>, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
 <br>web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for <q>Lorem Ipsum</q> will incover
 <br>many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
 <br>sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
