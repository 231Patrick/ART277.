            <p>We’ve heard it all since the pandemic started — lemon juice can kill the coronavirus, masks 
                don’t work, if you already had <a herf="">COVID-19</a> you can’t get it again or that the vaccines approved for 
                emergency use will change your DNA or put a tracking device in your body.

            <p>It’s almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out all of the misinformation. But 
                despite all the myths and urban legends, about half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.

                Wonderful news, right? Wonderful news, right? 
                Well, not to some. Vaccinated people are up against a 
                new set of myths — they’re literally magnetic or 
                they’re going to shed vaccine components and alter 
                the DNA of unvaccinated people. And despite the extra 
                layer of protection, they still have to grapple with the 
                same pandemic realities as everyone else. So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread 
                COVID-19 to others? Infectious disease specialist Lyssette Cardona, MD, answers those 
                questions and covers why vaccination is still one of our best weapons in the fight against 
                COVID-19.</p>

        <h2>“Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19”</h2> 
        <p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully 
            vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still 
            isn’t the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that 
            you could become infected. 
            Dr. Cardona explains. 
            “‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for 
            the best protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No 
            vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off 
            the infectious consequences of being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”</p> 
        <h2>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to 
            others, including other vaccinated people?</h2>
            <p>
                While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower 
rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune 
response to vaccines. 
“The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health 
disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 
vaccines. We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in 
these vulnerable populations.”
