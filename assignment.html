    <h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>
    <p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought <br>
        me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has <br> 
        given me a unique learning experience <br>
        <br>
        At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the <br> 
        heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways <br>
        on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and <br>
        <img src="girl.jpeg" alt="A girl" style="width: 20%; float:left; margin: 10px;"> 
        walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the <br>
        thousand-year-old stones were still in place. <br>
        It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first <br>
        became interested in language. <br>
        It began with French, which taught me the importance of <br>
        pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris <br>
        where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it <br>
        PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on <br>
        the A, she looked at me bewildered. <br>
        In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and <br>
        aware of its similarities with English through cognates. <br>
        Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks <br>
        different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to <br>
        me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates <br>
        come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. <br>
        Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my <br>
        school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I <br>
        loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning <br>
        fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means <br>
        volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty <br> 
        and rhythm as I form them.</p>
